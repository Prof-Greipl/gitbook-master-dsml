Your lecturer will advise on materials to read.

### Languages and Tools

#### Colab

* \[C1\] [https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI) \(mandatory\)

#### Phython

* \[P1\] [https://www.w3schools.com/python/](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) A simple introduction to Phython. Your first choice to understand, how things work, but limited in scope
* \[P2\] [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) The complete reference. We need only a limited number of language elements. mostly in chapters 7. and 8.

#### Numpy

* \[N1\] [https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html)

  The use Numpy to manage matrices and vectors. Focus on [https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.creation.html](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.creation.html) and [https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.rec.html](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.rec.html)

#### Pandas

Pandas is a data analysis toolkit to be used in Phython. It is wide used to analyse and prepare source data.

* \[P1\] [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting\_started/10min.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) \(mandatory\)

#### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures. We use it to visualize data, training processes and model quality.

* \[MP\] [https://matplotlib.org/](https://matplotlib.org/)

#### Keras

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python. It allows us to quickly develop ML models.

* \[K1\] [https://keras.io/\#getting-started-30-seconds-to-keras](https://keras.io/#getting-started-30-seconds-to-keras)

## Text Books, Articles and Videos

* \[FRA\] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMcjV8xwapk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMcjV8xwapk) \(mandatory\) Watch this, to understand the key terminology. Part of the Google ML crash course.
* \[NIE\] [http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/about.html](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/about.html) A excellent on-line book by Michael Nielsen. I will exactly define the mandatory contents in the course. The most relevant chapter is [http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
* \[3B1\] [https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) \(mandatory\) You _must_ watch this before diving into the course. It serves as a background of the whole course.
* \[SMO\] [https://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf](https://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf) _Introduction to Machine Learning_ by Alex Smola. Very good in highlighting the mathematical background.
* \[GML\] [https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) A brilliant high-level source to dive into ML.
* \[EDS\] Einf√ºhrung in Data Science: Grundprinzipien der Datenanalyse mit Python \(Animals\) von Joel Grus , Kristian Rother, et al. \| 21. November 2019
